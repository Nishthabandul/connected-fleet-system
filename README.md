Connected Car Fleet Management System
This project is a backend API built with FastAPI that helps monitor and manage a fleet of connected vehicles. It collects real-time telemetry data, stores it, and provides insights about vehicle performance, fuel usage, and fleet activity.

It's designed to be lightweight, modular, and easy to expand—whether you're working with a handful of vehicles or scaling to a full connected fleet.

What This Project Does
Manage Vehicles
Add new vehicles to your fleet, look up details, or remove them when needed.

Collect Telemetry
Each vehicle sends real-time data like GPS location, speed, engine status, fuel level, and diagnostic codes. The system stores this data for later analysis.

View Telemetry History
You can retrieve all telemetry records or just the latest data for any vehicle.

Get Fleet-Level Analytics
Generate a summary of your entire fleet—like how many vehicles are active, average fuel level, and total distance traveled in the last 24 hours.

Alerts System (Pluggable)
The structure includes support for future alerting, like flagging vehicles with critical diagnostic issues.
